### Welcome to the John Smith: Technician's Remix 1.6 Repository ###
------------------------------------------------------------------

### ***JSTR for MC 1.6*** ###

Please be aware due to constant state of flux MC has been experencing in relation to texture/resource packs within the past few months, the 1.6 JSTR is in a very WIP state at the moment.  This will hopefully stablise as future versions of MC release without further changes, we can then focus on mod additions alone, rather than completlely converting each and every texture to suit the new formats.
